# Spam Email Classification
## Project Overview
This project aims to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam) using machine learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, vectorized, and used to train multiple models to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- NLTK
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  
## Steps in the Project
### 1) Data Preprocessing
- Removed stopwords
- Performed tokenization and stemming
- Applied TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
### 2) Machine Learning Models Used
Implemented and compared the following classifiers:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Na√Øve Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
### 3) Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score calculated for each model
- Used Confusion Matrix to visualize performance
